Ryno's Toontown Infinite Modifications
================

Mods of Toontown Infinite.  Kinda been in some drama but who cares?  Not me.

What's so special about this?  It has naked Toons, some retro stuff (like retro make-a-toon), classic character transformations, Cog Disguise versatility, TTR's Toon Species, and other stuff.  Much of it has made it to Toontown Offline, but Toontown Offline is an actual project.  This is more of a code playground.
